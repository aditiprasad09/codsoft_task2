-> This is a simple Java console application where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

-> The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 

-> It tracks the number of attempts and rounds played, displaying the user's score based on the total number of attempts and average attempts per round.

-> Users can play multiple rounds and choose to stop playing at any time. 

"This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation".
